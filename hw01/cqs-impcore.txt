### Readings and Questions ###

Please read pages 17--26 in *Programming Languages: Build, Prove, and Compare*.

1.  What is the value of the following Impcore expression?

        (if (> 3 5) 17 99)

    > 99

2.  Which of the following best describes the syntactic structure of
    Impcore?

    (a)   An expression can be made with any definition as one of its parts
    (b)   A definition can be made with any expression as one of its parts
    (c)   Both of the above
    (d)   None of the above

    > (b)

3.  Does the following Impcore test pass? Please answer "yes" or "no."

        (check-expect (+ 1 2 3) 6)

    > no

    Assuming `x` is bound to a global variable, does the following
    Impcore test pass? Again, please answer "yes" or "no."

        (check-expect (set x 1) 1)

    > Yes

In *Seven Lessons in Program Design*, on Canvas, read the
Introduction and Lesson 1.

4.  I show you a recursive function `f` that takes one argument, 
    a natural number `n`.  The structure of `n`, and therefore the
    internal structure of `f`, are based on the Peano proof system from
    the handout.

    (a) What are the different ways `n` can be formed?

    > 'n' can be be in the form "0", or "(m + 1)", where m is a natural number
    
    (b) In the implementation of `f`, what Impcore code should `f` use to
        test the form of `n`?

    > (if = n 0). If true then n has the form "0"
    
    (c) For which forms of `n` do you expect `f` to make a recursive call? This
        should match one of the forms you provided in part (a).

    > 'f' will make a recursive call when the form of n is (m + 1)

    (d) When a recursive call is made, what value is passed as the argument?
        Write this value as an Impcore expression.

    > The value passed as the argument is m. Impcore expression: (f m)
    
Read the section titled "What is a contract?" in the Course Style Guidelines
on Canvas.

5.  Suppose I write a contract for a `power` function that says, "this
    function multiplies $x$ by itself $n$ times."  According to our
    expectations, is this a good contract or a bad contract?
    Please answer "good" or "bad."

    > bad

6.  In *Seven Lessons in Program Design*, just before the end of
    Lesson 1, you will find a section on "Complete process examples."
    This section suggests that the `factorial` function---but not the
    `power` function---could be submitted without a contract.
    
    (a) Why would it be OK to submit the `factorial` function without
        a contract?  For an idea, look at the "Exemplary" column in
        the "Documentation" section of the general coding rubric.

    > Yes, because the contract is trivial, the name of the function is enough
    to function as a contract itself

    (b) Why doesn't the same argument apply to the `power` function?
        For an idea, check the design lesson.

    > Because the contract for the 'power' function is not trivial.
      It has to specify what each parameter does.

You're all done!
