Reading comprehension for operational semantics
-----------------------------------------------
*Download* and edit this file, `cqs-opsem.txt`, to answer the
questions below.  If your editor is not good with Greek letters, you
can spell out their names: ξ is $\xi$, ϕ is $\phi$, and ρ is $\rho$.

Once you've edited the file, submit it by uploading it to the homework
server and running command `submit105-cqs`.

For questions 1--7, please read pages 28--37 (the book sections on
environments and on operational semantics of expressions).

And on page 75, be sure you are comfortable with questions
G through L, and N.  (Do not submit any answers to those questions;
they are just there to let you know if you are ready.)

Questions 1--7 are multiple-choice.

 1. $\xi$ (ξ) is an environment that maps names to

    (a) *only* user-defined functions.
    (b) *only* the values of formal parameters.
    (c) *both* primitive and user-defined functions.
    (d) the values of *both* global variables and formal parameters.
    (e) *only* primitive functions.
    (f) *only* the values of global variables.

    Answer: (f)

 2. $\phi$ (ϕ) is an environment that maps names to

    (a) *only* user-defined functions.
    (b) *only* the values of formal parameters.
    (c) *both* primitive and user-defined functions.
    (d) the values of *both* global variables and formal parameters.
    (e) *only* primitive functions.
    (f) *only* the values of global variables.

    Answer: (c)

 3. $\rho$ (ρ) is an environment that maps names to

    (a) *only* user-defined functions.
    (b) *only* the values of formal parameters.
    (c) *both* primitive and user-defined functions.
    (d) the values of *both* global variables and formal parameters.

    (f) *only* the values of global variables.

    Answer: (b)

 4. In the operational semantics, what kind of a thing does the
    metavariable $e$ stand for?

    (a) an environment
    (b) an Impcore variable
    (c) a function
    (d) an expression
    (e) a value

    Answer: (d)

 5. In the operational semantics, what kind of a thing does the
    metavariable $v$ stand for?

    (a) an environment
    (b) an Impcore variable
    (c) a function
    (d) an expression
    (e) a value

    Answer: (e)

 6. In the operational semantics, what kind of a thing does the
    phrase "ρ{x ↦ 7}(x)" ($\rho\{x \mapsto 7\}(x)$) stand for?

    (a) an environment
    (b) an Impcore variable
    (c) a function
    (d) an expression
    (e) a value

    Answer: (e)

 7. In the operational semantics, what kind of a thing does the
    phrase "ρ{x ↦ 7}{x ↦ 8}" ($\rho\{x \mapsto 7\}\{x \mapsto 8\}$)
    stand for?

    (a) an environment
    (b) an Impcore variable
    (c) a function
    (d) an expression
    (e) a value

    Answer: (a)

Questions 8 and 9 are also based on
pages 28--37.
Please answer a number.

 8. How many rules have the IF syntactic form in the conclusion?

   Answer: 3

 9. How many rules have the APPLY syntactic form in the conclusion?

    (Count *all* the rules that are written in the section, not only 
    the rules in the summary on page 80.
    And count *only* the rules that are *written* in the section,
    not rules that are merely implied.)

    Answer: 5

Now let's understand a subtle point about rules. Study the FormalVar
and FormalAssign rules starting on page 32.  In FormalVar, the initial
and final states have the same $\rho$ (ρ).  But in the FormalAssign rule,
there is an initial state with $\rho$ (ρ), an intermediate state with
$\rho'$ (ρ'), and a final state with ρ'{x ↦ v} ($\rho'\{x \mapsto v\}$).
Answer these questions:

10. In rule FormalVar, the initial and final state have the same $\rho$ (ρ) 
    because

    (a) Evaluating $x$ might change the value of some formal parameter.
    (b) Evaluating $x$ might not change the value of any formal parameter.
    (c) Evaluating $x$ doesn't change the value of any formal parameter.

    Answer: (c)
      
11. In rule FormalAssign, there is an intermediate state with $\rho'$ (ρ')
    (rho-prime) because

    (a) Evaluating $e$ might change the value of some formal parameter.
    (b) Evaluating $e$ might not change the value of any formal parameter.
    (c) Evaluating $e$ doesn't change the value of any formal parameter.

    Answer: (a)

12. Consider the sample derivation on page 58.
    The same $\rho$ (ρ) is used throughout the derivation because

    (a) Every subexpression is known, and because there is no unknown
        subexpression, there is no need for a $\rho'$ (ρ') (rho-prime).
    (b) No part of the evaluation changes the value of a formal parameter.
    (c) The example derivation takes a shortcut and doesn't actually
        conform to the rules.

   Answer: (c)
