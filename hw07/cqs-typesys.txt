Reading comprehension for type systems
--------------------------------------
*Download* and edit this file, `cqs-typesys.txt`, to answer the questions
below.  Once you've edited the file, submit it by uploading it to the
homework server and running command `submit105-cqs`.

 1. Read section 6.3, which describes how Typed Impcore is extended 
    with arrays.  Examine code chunk 357, which shows
    the cases that have to be added to the type checker.

    For each case, name the type-system rule that applies.  Each
    answer should be a rule name like Apply or GlobalAssign.

      * The rule for case `| ty (AAT (a, i)) = ...` is:

      ArrayAt


      * The rule for case `| ty (APUT (a, i, e)) = ...` is:

      ArrayPut


      * The rule for case `| ty (AMAKE (len, init)) = ...` is:

      MakeArray


      * The rule for case `| ty (ASIZE a) = ...` is:

      ArraySize


    Now pick one of the rules and explain, in informal English, what
    the rule is supposed to do.

    ArrayAt: ArrayAt ensures not only that a is of type Array, but also
    that i is of type int

 2. Read section 6.6.3 on quantified types in Typed μScheme.
    In addition to the prose, read the transcripts in the first couple
    pages of that section: each value that has a quantified type is
    instantiated later in the transcript, giving you more examples to
    relate back to the prose.

    (a) Assume variable `syms` holds a list of symbols (it has type
        `(list sym)`).  What expression do you write to compute its
        length? Pick exactly one of the options below.

        1. `(length syms)`
        2. `((o length sym) syms)`
        3. `((@ length sym) syms)`
        4. `((length sym) syms)`

        Answer: 4


    (b) You are given a function `positive?` of type `(int -> bool)`.
        Using the predefined function `o`, which has type
        `(forall ('a 'b 'c) (('b -> 'c) ('a -> 'b) -> ('a -> 'c)))`,
        what code do you write to compose `positive?` with `not`?

        (o not positive? 'a)


    (c) In testing, we sometimes use a three-argument function `third`
        that ignores its first two arguments and returns its third
        argument.  Such a function has type

            (forall ('a 'b 'c) ('a 'b 'c -> 'c))

        There is only one sensible function that has this type.  Using
        a `val` definition, define function `third` in Typed μScheme. 
        You will need to use both `type-lambda` and `lambda`.

        (val third
            (type-lambda ['a 'b 'c]
                (lambda ([x : 'c])
                    x)))

 3. Read about type equivalence starting on page 378 and page 380.

    You are given ML values `tau1` and `tau2`, which represent the
    respective Typed μScheme types `(forall ('a) 'a)` and `(forall ('b) 'b)`.
    Semantically, these types are equivalent. For each of the two ML
    expressions below, say whether the expression produces `true`
    or produces `false`. Write each answer immediately below the
    expression.

    (a) `tau1 = tau2`

    Amswer: false


    (b) `eqType (tau1, tau2)`

    Answer: true


    _You will soon be ready for exercise 19, but
    you first need to complete the next two comprehension questions._


 4. Go back to section 6.6.5, which starts on page 370,
    and read the typing rules for expressions in Typed μScheme.
    For each of the expressions below, say if it is well typed, and if
    so, **what type it has**.  If the expression is not well typed, say
    what typing rule fails and why.

        ; (a)
        (if #t 1 #f)

        Answer: Not well typed, If rule fails because 1 and #f are not of the
        same type

        ; (b)
        (let ([x 1]
              [y 2])
           (+ x y))

        Answer: Well typed, has type int

        ; (c)
        (lambda ([x : int]) x)

        Answer: Well typed, has type int

        ; (d)
        (lambda ([x : 'a]) x)

        Answer: Not well typed, Lambda rule fails because 'a is not given in 
        the environment

        ; (e)
        (type-lambda ['a] (lambda ([x : 'a]) x))

        Answer: Well typed, has type 'a
  
    _You are almost ready for exercise 19._


 5. Read Lesson 5 ("Program design with typing rules") of 
    _Seven Lessons in Program Design_.  In particular, read the
    explanation of how the If rule is rewritten to add
    type-equality judgments τ ≡ τ3 and τ1 ≡ bool.  Now look at the
    list of typing rules for expressions in Figure 6.12 on page 405
    in *Programming Languages: Build, Prove, and Compare*.
    Identify one other rule that needs to be rewritten in the same
    fashion as If, for the same reason.
    
    The rule you found is named → WHILE


    _You are now ready for exercise 19._

 6. Homework exercise A calls for you to add a primitive array type to
    Typed μScheme. Read it.  Then read "Primitive type constructors of
    Typed uScheme" in section 6.6.10, which starts on page 390.

    (a) When you add a primitive type constructor for arrays, what
        chunk of the source code do you intend to add it to?
        (Give the page number, and if applicable, the letter. For example,
        page 390 has chunks 390a and
        390b, and the letter is the simplest way to
        distinguish the two.)

        Answer: page 390 chunk 390a



    Right after the primitive type constructors, you will find
    "Selected primitive functions of Typed μScheme" (pages
    390 and 391).  Study the definitions of the primitive functions
    that are shown there.

    (b) Which set of primitive functions most resembles the functions
        you will need to add for arrays?

        Answer: The set of primitive functions shown in code chunk 391a


    (c) When you add primitive functions that operate on arrays, what
        chunk of the source code do you intend to add it to?
        (Just like we asked above, give the page number, and if
        applicable, the letter.)

        Answer: page 391 chunk 391c





    _You are ready for Exercise A._
